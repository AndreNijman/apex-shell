#  tests/atspi-walk.py — read an application's accessibility tree the way a
#  screen reader reads it, over AT-SPI on D-Bus.
#
#  This is the other half of tests/lib/atspi.sh. That file stands up a private
#  a11y bus; this one walks what an application publishes onto it.
#
#  ── Why this is not the same as reading Accessible.name in QML ──────────────
#
#  A QML assertion reads the attached object on a QQuickItem. AT-SPI reads what
#  the toolkit bridge decided to EXPORT, and the two differ in ways that matter
#  and are invisible from the QML side:
#
#    * The bridge suppresses some properties. Qt returns an empty name for any
#      item with Accessible.passwordEdit set (qquickaccessibleattached_p.h) --
#      so a password field that "has a name" in QML has none on the bus.
#    * The bridge applies its own role mapping, and roles that QML spells one
#      way arrive with AT-SPI's spelling and numbering.
#    * Items the bridge considers uninteresting never appear at all, so a
#      control can be perfectly labelled in QML and absent from the tree.
#    * Actions are a separate interface. "A screen reader can press this" is
#      org.a11y.atspi.Action, not a signal handler in QML.
#
#  ── Talking to the bus directly, and why ────────────────────────────────────
#
#  The obvious client is pyatspi, which is not installed here and is not in the
#  image. Rather than report the row unmeasurable over a Python binding, this
#  speaks the D-Bus interfaces itself through Gio -- which IS present, because
#  the installer's own test suite already depends on python3-gi. The protocol is
#  small: GetChildren, GetRole, GetState, GetInterfaces and the Action
#  interface are the whole of what is used here.
#
#  ── Safety ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  It refuses to run against anything but a private bus. AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS must
#  be set and must be a unix path; the caller (atspi.sh) has already checked
#  that the path is inside a directory it created. Without the variable this
#  exits non-zero rather than falling back to the session default, because the
#  session default on a developer's machine is a live desktop.
#
#  Usage:
#      atspi-walk.py --count                 how many apps are registered
#      atspi-walk.py --dump [--app NAME]     one line per node
#      atspi-walk.py --json [--app NAME]     the tree as JSON
#      atspi-walk.py --do-action NAME[:IDX] --app APP
#                                            press something, as a reader would

# Roles are NOT decoded from a table here. An earlier draft carried a hand-built
# map of AT-SPI role numbers and it was wrong in a way that would have poisoned
# every assertion built on it: a Qt EditableText arrived as 47 and the table
# called it "table-column", a push button came out as "panel". The enum has been
# renumbered across at-spi2 releases and a test that hardcodes one release's
# numbering is asserting against the wrong vocabulary on every other.
#
# So the role name is asked of the bus -- GetRoleName is part of the Accessible
# interface precisely so clients do not have to keep such a table. The numeric
# value is kept alongside it, because that is what a mutation can move.

# AT-SPI state bit numbers -> names. The bitset arrives as two uint32s.
